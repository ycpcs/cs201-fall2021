This schedule is subject to change.  Any change will be announced in class and on the course web page.

Please do the reading <i>before</i> you come to class.  Note that the reading includes both the lecture notes (the **Topic** column) and, if specified, the textbook reading (the **Reading** column.)

Code projects for the lectures are available on the [Examples](examples/index.html) page.

<div class="callout">
<b>Make sure you have set up the outer project directory properly as described in the Resources tab and load the example code via File&rarr;New&rarr;Module from Existing Sources... as a Gradle project.</b>
</div>

<script>
	console.log("Generating calendar!");
	autogenCalendar({ omitLabs: true, omitFinalExams: false });

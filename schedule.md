This schedule is subject to change.  Any change will be announced in class and on the course web page.

Please do the reading <i>before</i> you come to class.  Note that the reading includes both the lecture notes (the **Topic** column) and, if specified, the textbook reading (the **Reading** column.)

Code projects for the lectures are available on the [Examples](examples/index.html) page.

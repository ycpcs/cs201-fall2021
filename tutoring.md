## Asking Questions

The tutors' job is to help students in the course learn the material.  Please do take advantage of the tutoring when you need help, but always be aware that it is your responsibility to have done all relevant readings, labs, and CloudCoder exercises before you ask the tutors for assistance.  Be sure to read the [How to ask for help](HowToAskForHelp.html) document.

A schedule is forthcoming.

# Evening Sessions - Tuesday/Thursday, 6:00pm to 8:30pm in KEC124 

Drop-in tutoring sessions will be held Tuesdays and Thursdays from
6:00pm to 8:30pm in KEC124.  These sessions are a great way to get help with labs,
assignments, or anything else you have questions about.

**Important**: Be aware that the evening sessions can be very busy
close to an assignment deadline.  Your best bet is to *start assignments early*
and *ask questions early* to avoid the rush.

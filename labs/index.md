This page lists the lab activities.

In order to receive credit for completing a lab, you need to get a sign-off from your instructor or a tutor by demonstrating your completed lab *in person* (or *virtually* if you are fully remote). **Note:** Simply submitting the lab to Marmoset is *not* sufficient. There are two options for this:

1. For 100% of full credit: Get a sign-off by the end of the *next* class that your cohort is in the lab (i.e. the class that follows the two from the prior in class session), or if you are fully remote following the Cohort A (Tues in-class) schedule. Please refer to Canvas for the list of students in each cohort. 
2. For 80% of full credit: Get a sign-off **prior to the class before the next exam.**

Any labs not completed by the exam they precede will receive no credit.

<div class="callout">
<b>Protip</b>: Work on the labs <i>before</i> coming to class.  This will allow you to ask good questions when we work on the lab in class, and will give you a much better chance of finishing the lab in class.

See [Importing and Submitting](../resources/importSubmit.html) for instructions on importing and submitting labs.
